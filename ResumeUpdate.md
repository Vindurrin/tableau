Absolutely ‚Äî here's a strong resume bullet point that showcases your leadership, technical breadth, and forward-thinking automation approach. I've included placeholder metrics and impact language you can refine later as results come in.

üìù Resume Bullet (Automation + Governance + Tableau + Compliance)
Designed and implemented a fully automated Tableau Server governance framework on self-hosted infrastructure, using Python and REST APIs to detect and log stale users, content, sites, and extract schedules; built JSON-structured logs for optional integration with Grafana and Slack. Established policy-aligned thresholds (e.g., 365-day user inactivity, 730-day content aging) and scheduled weekly and semiannual scans with zero-downtime execution, enabling future deletion mode. Reduced administrative overhead by an estimated 40% and aligned Tableau usage with FERPA/NIST 800-171 compliance directives.

Alternate version (emphasizing initiative and tooling):
Proactively led Tableau Server automation initiative to implement intelligent, policy-driven cleanup of stale users, workbooks, and extract schedules. Leveraged Python, Tableau‚Äôs REST API, and SAML/PAT authentication to create log-only scripts with JSON output, ready for integration with Grafana and organizational alerting systems (Slack/email). Improved data hygiene and audit readiness, with a projected 20‚Äì50% reduction in stale content footprint and smoother capacity management for future growth or cloud migration.

You can later update with real numbers like:

"# of users/content flagged/removed"

"% storage reduction or CPU/RAM reclaimed"

"# of hours saved in manual admin work"

Let me know if you want one tuned more for DevOps, data governance, cost optimization, or compliance/security angles.
